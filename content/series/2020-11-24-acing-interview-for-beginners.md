Programming interviews are notoriously difficult. But it doesn't take a genius to ace the interview and land the job you want. This 6-post series, written for beginners, provides a simple step-by-step way to help you understand and solve programming problems. We'll start with an introduction to **why your resume is broken** and then dive into how you can stand out as a candidate.

For each of these posts, weâ€™ll:

At the end of the series, you'll have a better understanding of how you can land the job you want.
