This 4-post series, written especially with beginners in mind, provides a **fundamentals-oriented** approach towards understanding Neural Networks. We’ll start with an introduction to **classic Neural Networks** for complete beginners before delving into two popular variants: **Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNNs) and **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs).

For each of each these types of networks, we’ll:

- See the **structure** of the network.
- Understand the **motivation** behind using that type of network.
- Introduce a **real-world problem** that can be solved using that network.
- **Manually derive the gradients** needed to train our problem-specific network.
- **Implement a fully-functioning network completely from scratch** (using only [numpy](https://numpy.org/)) in Python.

## Background

**This series requires ZERO prior knowledge of Machine Learning** or Neural Networks. However, background in the following topics may be helpful:

- **Multivariable Calculus**, used when deriving the gradients needed to train our networks. These gradient derivations can be skipped if you don’t have the background.
- **Linear Algebra**, specifically Matrix algebra - matrices are often the best way to represent weights for Neural Networks.
- **Python 3**, because the Python implementations in these posts are a major part of their educational value. A baseline proficiency in Python is enough.
