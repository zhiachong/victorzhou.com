## What Next?

Still eager to learn? Some more things you can do include:

- [Build your first neural network with Keras](/blog/keras-neural-network-tutorial/).
- [Apply neural networks to Visual Question Answering (VQA)](/blog/easy-vqa/).
- Experiment with bigger / better neural networks using proper machine learning libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Try your hand at using Neural Networks to approach a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) data science competition.
- Review notes from Stanford's famous [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/) course on CNNs.
- Take one of many good Neural Networks courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=neural%20networks).

I plan on writing more about Neural Networks in the future, so [subscribe to my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=nn-series) if you want to get notified of new content.

Thanks for reading!
