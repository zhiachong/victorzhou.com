## What Next?

Still eager to learn? Some more things you can do include:

- Apply neural networks to [Visual Question Answering (VQA)](/blog/easy-vqa/), an interesting [Computer Vision](/tag/computer-vision/) problem.
- Try your hand at using Neural Networks to approach a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) data science competition.
- Take one of many good Neural Networks courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=neural%20networks).

I often write about Machine Learning, so [subscribe to my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=keras-series) if you want to get notified of new content.

Thanks for reading!
