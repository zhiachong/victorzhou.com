[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple [Convolutional Neural Network](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) (CNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.

This post is intended for **complete beginners to Keras** but does assume a **basic background knowledge of CNNs**. My [introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) covers everything you need to know (and more) for this post - read that first if necessary.

Here we go!

> Just want the code? The [full source code](#the-full-code) is at the end.

## The Problem: MNIST digit classification

We're going to tackle a classic introductory [Computer Vision](/tag/computer-vision/) problem: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) handwritten digit classification. It's simple: given an image, classify it as a digit.

![Sample images from the MNIST dataset](./media-link/cnn-post/mnist-examples.png "Sample images from the MNIST dataset")

Each image in the MNIST dataset is 28x28 and contains a centered, grayscale digit. Our CNN will take an image and output one of 10 possible classes (one for each digit).

## 1. Setup

I'm assuming you already have a basic Python installation (you probably do). Let's first download some packages we'll need:

```bash
$ pip install tensorflow numpy mnist
```

> Note: We don't need to install the `keras` package because it now comes bundled with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as its official high-level API! Using TensorFlow's Keras is now recommended over the standalone `keras` package.

You should now be able to import these packages and poke around the MNIST dataset:

```python
import numpy as np
import mnist
from tensorflow import keras

# The first time you run this might be a bit slow, since the
# mnist package has to download and cache the data.
train_images = mnist.train_images()
train_labels = mnist.train_labels()

print(train_images.shape) # (60000, 28, 28)
print(train_labels.shape) # (60000,)
```

## 2. Preparing the Data

Before we begin, we'll normalize the image pixel values from [0, 255] to [-0.5, 0.5] to make our network easier to train (using smaller, centered values usually leads to better results). We'll also reshape each image from `(28, 28)` to `(28, 28, 1)` because Keras requires the third dimension.

```python
import numpy as np
import mnist

train_images = mnist.train_images()
train_labels = mnist.train_labels()
test_images = mnist.test_images()
test_labels = mnist.test_labels()

# Normalize the images.
train_images = (train_images / 255) - 0.5
test_images = (test_images / 255) - 0.5

# Reshape the images.
train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=3)
test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, axis=3)

print(train_images.shape) # (60000, 28, 28, 1)
print(test_images.shape)  # (10000, 28, 28, 1)
```

We're ready to start building our CNN!

## 3. Building the Model

Every Keras model is either built using the [Sequential](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) class, which represents a linear stack of layers, or the functional [Model](https://keras.io/models/model/) class, which is more customizeable. We'll be using the simpler `Sequential` model, since our CNN will be a linear stack of layers.

We start by instantiating a `Sequential` model:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# WIP
model = Sequential([
  # layers...
])
```

The `Sequential` constructor takes an array of Keras [Layers](https://keras.io/layers/about-keras-layers/). We'll use 3 types of layers for our CNN: **Convolutional**, **Max Pooling**, and **Softmax**.

![](/media/cnn-post/cnn-dims-3.svg)

> This is the same CNN setup we used in my [introduction to CNNs](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/). Read that post if you're not comfortable with any of these 3 types of layers.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten

num_filters = 8
filter_size = 3
pool_size = 2

model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])
```

- `num_filters`, `filter_size`, and `pool_size` are self-explanatory variables that set the hyperparameters for our CNN.
- The first layer in any `Sequential` model must specify the `input_shape`, so we do so on `Conv2D`. Once this input shape is specified, Keras will automatically infer the shapes of inputs for later layers.
- The output [Softmax](/blog/softmax/) layer has 10 nodes, one for each class.

## 4. Compiling the Model

Before we can begin training, we need to configure the training process. We decide 3 key factors during the compilation step:

- The **optimizer**. We'll stick with a pretty good default: the [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) gradient-based optimizer. Keras has [many other optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you can look into as well.
- The **loss function**. Since we're using a Softmax output layer, we'll use the Cross-Entropy loss. Keras distinguishes between `binary_crossentropy` (2 classes) and `categorical_crossentropy` (>2 classes), so we'll use the latter. [See all Keras losses](https://keras.io/losses/).
- A list of **metrics**. Since this is a classification problem, we'll just have Keras report on the **accuracy** metric.

Here's what that compilation looks like:

```python
model.compile(
  'adam',
  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
  metrics=['accuracy'],
)
```

Onwards!

## 5. Training the Model

Training a model in Keras literally consists only of calling `fit()` and specifying some parameters. There are [a lot of possible parameters](https://keras.io/models/sequential/#fit), but we'll only supply these:

- The **training data** (images and labels), commonly known as X and Y, respectively.
- The **number of epochs** (iterations over the entire dataset) to train for.
- The **validation data** (or test data), which is used during training to periodically measure the network's performance against data it hasn't seen before.

There's one thing we have to be careful about: Keras expects the training targets to be _10-dimensional vectors_, since there are 10 nodes in our Softmax output layer. Right now, our `train_labels` and `test_labels` arrays contain _single integers representing the class_ for each image:

```python
import mnist

train_labels = mnist.train_labels()
print(train_labels[0]) # 5
```

Conveniently, Keras has a utility method that fixes this exact issue: [to_categorical](https://keras.io/utils/#to_categorical). It turns our array of class integers into an array of [one-hot](/blog/one-hot/) vectors instead. For example, `2` would become `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (it's zero-indexed).

Here's what that looks like:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

model.fit(
  train_images,
  to_categorical(train_labels),
  epochs=3,
  validation_data=(test_images, to_categorical(test_labels)),
)
```

We can now put everything together to train our network:

```python
import numpy as np
import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

train_images = mnist.train_images()
train_labels = mnist.train_labels()
test_images = mnist.test_images()
test_labels = mnist.test_labels()

# Normalize the images.
train_images = (train_images / 255) - 0.5
test_images = (test_images / 255) - 0.5

# Reshape the images.
train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=3)
test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, axis=3)

num_filters = 8
filter_size = 3
pool_size = 2

# Build the model.
model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])

# Compile the model.
model.compile(
  'adam',
  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
  metrics=['accuracy'],
)

# Train the model.
model.fit(
  train_images,
  to_categorical(train_labels),
  epochs=3,
  validation_data=(test_images, to_categorical(test_labels)),
)
```

Running that code on the full MNIST dataset gives us results like this:

```
Epoch 1
loss: 0.2433 - acc: 0.9276 - val_loss: 0.1176 - val_acc: 0.9634
Epoch 2
loss: 0.1184 - acc: 0.9648 - val_loss: 0.0936 - val_acc: 0.9721
Epoch 3
loss: 0.0930 - acc: 0.9721 - val_loss: 0.0778 - val_acc: 0.9744
```

We achieve **97.4%** test accuracy with this simple CNN!

## 6. Using the Model

Now that we have a working, trained model, let's put it to use. The first thing we'll do is save it to disk so we can load it back up anytime:

```python
model.save_weights('cnn.h5')
```

We can now reload the trained model whenever we want by rebuilding it and loading in the saved weights:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten

num_filters = 8
filter_size = 3
pool_size = 2

# Build the model.
model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])

# Load the model's saved weights.
model.load_weights('cnn.h5')
```

Using the trained model to make predictions is easy: we pass an array of inputs to `predict()` and it returns an array of outputs. Keep in mind that the output of our network is 10 probabilities (because of softmax), so we'll use [np.argmax()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html) to turn those into actual digits.

```python
# Predict on the first 5 test images.
predictions = model.predict(test_images[:5])

# Print our model's predictions.
print(np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)) # [7, 2, 1, 0, 4]

# Check our predictions against the ground truths.
print(test_labels[:5]) # [7, 2, 1, 0, 4]
```

## 8. Extensions

There's much more we can do to experiment with and improve our network - in this [official Keras MNIST CNN example](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/), they achieve **99.25%** test accuracy after 12 epochs. Some examples of modifications you could make to our CNN include:

### Network Depth

What happens if we add or remove Convolutional layers? How does that affect training and/or the model's final performance?

```python
model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size), # highlight-line
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])
```

### Dropout

What if we tried adding [Dropout](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout) layers, which are commonly used to prevent overfitting?

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout # highlight-line

model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Dropout(0.5), # highlight-line
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])
```

### Fully-connected Layers

What if we add fully-connected layers between the Convolutional outputs and the final Softmax layer? This is something commonly done in CNNs used for [Computer Vision](/tag/computer-vision/).

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense # highlight-line

model = Sequential([
  Conv2D(num_filters, filter_size, input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(64, activation='relu'), # highlight-line
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])
```

### Convolution Parameters

What if we play with the [Conv2D](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d) parameters? For example:

```python
# These can be changed, too!
num_filters = 8
filter_size = 3

model = Sequential([
  # See https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d for more info.
  Conv2D(
    num_filters,
    filter_size,
    input_shape=(28, 28, 1),
    strides=2, # highlight-line
    padding='same', # highlight-line
    activation='relu', # highlight-line
  ),
  MaxPooling2D(pool_size=pool_size),
  Flatten(),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])
```
