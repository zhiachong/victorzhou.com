Today is my 6 month anniversary of starting this blog! ðŸŽ‰

In my [First 50 Days of Blogging](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/) post, I outlined some (rather ambitious) goals for my first year of blogging (Year One):

- Publish **50** blog posts.
- Get a **million** pageviews.
- Grow [my newsletter](/subscribe/?src=6-months-blogging) to **10,000** subscribers.

Here's where I'm at as of today:

- Published **24** blog posts.
- Gotten **314k** pageviews.
- Grown my newsletter to **2,000** subscribers.

I'm on track to hit my blog posts goal, but there's still some ground to make up for the other two goals ðŸ˜….

Let's get into the numbers more!

## Pageviews

Here's a graph of my blog's pageviews over the past 6 months:

The spikes correspond to popular posts:

- 2/11: [Can You Find The Bug in This Code?](/blog/a-javascript-bug-i-had-once/)
- 3/6: [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)
- 4/3: [Why I Replaced Disqus and You Should Too](/blog/replacing-disqus/)
- 4/11: [Random Forests for Complete Beginners](/blog/intro-to-random-forests/)
- 5/22: [CNNs, Part 1: An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/)
- 7/3: [Mailchimp to Sendy: How I Cut Email Costs by 100x](/blog/mailchimp-to-sendy/)
- 7/25: [An Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks for Beginners](/blog/intro-to-rnns/)

My top 5 posts by pageviews so far are:

| Page | Pageviews |
| ---- | --------- |
| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/">/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/</a> | 71,431 |
| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/intro-to-random-forests/">/blog/intro-to-random-forests/</a> | 33,579 |
| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/">/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/</a> | 25,148 |
| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/intro-to-rnns/">/blog/intro-to-rnns/</a> | 14,457 |
| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/">/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/</a> | 13,215 |

The top 5 consist of 4 Machine Learning posts, each of which got popular on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) shortly after being published. The 5th is a dark horse: my [guide to Building Multiplayer (.io) Web Games](/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/). Most of the traffic to that post has been organic - aside from a [podcast](/blog/creating-and-selling-io-games/) I did on that subject, there wasn't significant attention for that post when it came out.

## Organic Traffic

Despite being behind on my Year One goals, I see a clear silver lining: **organic traffic** growth. ðŸ“ˆ

![Performance on Google Search Results over the past 6 months](./media-link/6-months-post/organic.png)

My blog has gone from 20 clicks per day at the 50 day mark to **500+** clicks per day at the 6 month mark!

Incredibly, my simple [Gini Impurity](/blog/gini-impurity/) post is by far my blog's biggest driver of organic traffic. It's usually the second (sometimes the first!) result on Google when you search "gini impurity":

One of my original [reasons for starting this blog](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/#why) was to "learn more about and get firsthand experience with [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)," and I'm excited to continue doing so.

## Conclusion

It's been a great journey so far, and I'm excited for what the future holds. As always, **thank you to my readers** from the past 6 months! See you at the [Year One recap](/blog/year-one/).
