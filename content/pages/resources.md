# Resources I Recommend

### Equipment

These are the equipment I use and recommend for coding, work, editing and recording Youtube videos.

## [Das Keyboard](https://amzn.to/2YiZ2Cr)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5

<figure> [  
 ![](../uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-23-at-15.13.48.png) ](https://amzn.to/2YiZ2Cr)<figcaption>Das Model S Brown Keycap</figcaption></figure> [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2YiZ2Cr)

I‚Äôve tried many keyboards, from Apple keyboards, Microsoft ergonomics, Razer etc. I found that the quality, fit, finish, and ergonomics of the Das keyboard to be the best of them all. I use Brown keycaps. I prefer the Model S Professional because it‚Äôs the same great quality at a lower price point. **Highly recommended keyboard** for any professional typer or coder.

## [Airpods Pro](https://amzn.to/2DxAxZA)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5

<figure> [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-12.22.08.png) ](https://amzn.to/2WgClA2)<figcaption>Airpods Pro</figcaption></figure> [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2WgClA2)

For portability and great sound quality, the Airpods Pro do extremely well. I personally like the Bose headphones when I‚Äôm sitting down, but the Airpods Pro for portability is much better.

The battery life is amazing (5+ hours) on a single charge, which is enough for my day-to-day use. It‚Äôs light, and something I can throw in my backpack and go. The sound quality is great, much better than I imagined.

The noise cancellation works great ‚Äì it reduces ambient noise and consistent hums (e.g. vacuum cleaner) very well. For human conversations, they do an OK job.

For an in-depth review, check out my video on the Airpods Pro [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMMaes27ks).

## [Bose QC35 Headphones](https://amzn.to/2DxAxZA)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5

<figure> [  
 ![](../uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-22.19.47.png) ](https://amzn.to/2DxAxZA)<figcaption>Bose QC35</figcaption></figure> [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2DxAxZA)

In an open office environment, a good pair of headphones is a **MUST-HAVE.**

For me, I travel on planes quite a bit, and the noise around my office space can be quite overwhelming at times. I‚Äôve tried many pairs of headphones like Bose QC25, Sennheiser Momentum, Beats by Dr. Dre, and couldn‚Äôt really find a good fit until I found this.

QC35 is a bit on the pricier side, but the noise-cancellation is amazing, it‚Äôs extremely lightweight, and it holds up to rugged use. I throw it in my backpack and go. So far, it has worked amazingly well for me. And it syncs with multiple devices via Bluetooth seamlessly.

5 out of 5 for me.

## [LG 34-inch Curved Monitor](https://amzn.to/2Ykr4O2)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4.5/5

<figure> [  
 ![](../uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-23-at-15.22.41.png) ](https://amzn.to/2Ykr4O2)<figcaption>LG 34-inch 4K monitor</figcaption></figure> [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2Ykr4O2)

The best upgrade for any software engineer is a monitor. A 3-monitor setup is usually ideal (according to many online [articles),](https://blog.codinghorror.com/three-monitors-for-every-user/) but for the average Joe, I think the LG 34-inch curved monitor fits the bill.

You get 4K resolution at 34-inches, which is plenty for all your coding needs. And it supports HDMI2, Thunderbolt, and DisplayPort. For all my coding needs, this monitor fits the bill. And I love how it looks on my desk.

The only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt support USB-C, which otherwise would‚Äôve made it much more perfect.

## [AudioEngine A2+ Speakers](https://amzn.to/2Ykr4O2)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4.5/5

<figure> [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-8.17.19-PM.png) ](https://amzn.to/2x6L1OT)<figcaption>Audioengine A2+</figcaption></figure> [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2x6L1OT)

These are the quintessential speakers for the minimalist desk setup üôÇ

The sound quality‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôs not amazing. For the price, I think it‚Äôs decent (~\$250). Mostly I‚Äôm paying for the good looks üôÇ

I‚Äôd recommend getting these [Desktop Stands](https://amzn.to/2IRJleX) for optimized listening experience ‚Äì it definitely made a difference for me.

## [15inch Macbook Pro Retina](https://amzn.to/2UZeaTz)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4.5/5

Updated: 3/24/2019

My laptop of choice: 15‚Ä≥ Macbook Pro with Retina display, Touch bar, 16Gb RAM and 512GB SSD. Gorgeous display, fast processor, and TONS of RAM for multitasking. ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/2764.svg)

For both work and leisure, this laptop satisfies my needs, and then some. I‚Äôm not a huge gamer, so I can‚Äôt vouch for its gaming capabilities. However, for all my coding, video editing needs, this laptop is second to none. I love the MacOS ecosystem, and this is the best laptop money can buy for me at this point.

The only downside here would be its bulk and keyboard. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the new keyboard. I see where Apple is going with the low-profile keyboard, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan.

## [Apple Magic Trackpad 2 Wireless](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [  
 ![](../uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-10.15.23.png) ](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)  
 [

 ](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

I use Apple‚Äôs Magic Trackpad Wireless for my day-to-day operation. I moved away from a mouse a long time ago, and haven‚Äôt looked back since.

This Trackpad with wireless connectivity is rechargeable (saves me the need to buy AA batteries), and it‚Äôs connected by bluetooth. My entire workplace looks streamlined and clean due to this little magic item.

I love this trackpad and highly recommend it over the older trackpad as the new one is bigger and supports Force Touch (ability to detect press pressure).

## [Foldable Couch](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-8.22.15-PM.png) ](https://amzn.to/2vrLHOB)  
 [  
 Buy it on Amazon US  
 ](https://amzn.to/2vrLHOB)

Probably the best purchase in terms of furniture for my home office üôÇ

I especially enjoy the flexibility of the couch ‚Äì the folding couch lets me use them in different positions. I can lay flat, seated upright for reading, or bend it slightly to get a little more support for my back‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs a great space saver for smaller places too as you can fold and put it away if you don‚Äôt need it.

The only thing to take note of is that washing it can be a pain sometimes. I put a cover over it sometimes, but mostly I try not to have liquids around to avoid having to wash it üôÇ

## [Ergonomic Chair](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4.5/5  
 [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-8.28.02-PM.png) ](https://amzn.to/2Qlfj7g)  
 [

 ](https://amzn.to/2Qlfj7g)

If you‚Äôre working 8-9 hours on a desk like me, then you need to find a great chair. Consider this an investment for your own health.

I looked around, and found that this was a good fit for my situation. I like that you can adjust various parts of the chair, from the headrest, armrest, and even the lumbar support.

Mesh works better over summer as you don‚Äôt sweat as much. Leather, on the other hand, is a mess during summer as all that heat builds up üôÅ

If you have some extra cash, then the [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Classic-Aeron-Chair/dp/B07N4C4G53/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=herman+miller+aeron&qid=1584415982&sr=8-5) is a great choice ‚Äì try to find them from your local second-hand furniture store as many startups tend to buy them in bulk and liquidate for cheap when they close shop.

## [Canon SL2](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4.5/5  
 [

Great bang-for-the-buck DSLR that works great for my use cases. I initially bought this for photography purposes. My old T2i broke down after a trip to the sand dunes üôÅ

This camera has a flip-over screen, which is really nice for seeing myself when I‚Äôm recording. It has support for 1080p videos, mic-in support, and light enough for daily travels. The facial tracking feature is definitely awesome.

Add to it you can use all the popular Canon L and non-L lenses, this is a winner in my opinion.

## [Takstar Mic](https://amzn.to/2HCNVPC)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-8.41.18-PM.png) ](https://amzn.to/3bd0tbl)  
 [

 ](https://amzn.to/3bd0tbl)

For \$20, this mic is UNBEATABLE.

I‚Äôve tried the Rode Mic (quintessential Youtuber‚Äôs mic), and various others. The Rode Mic is awesome, but it‚Äôs also \$300. I wasn‚Äôt ready to throw all that money for a channel that‚Äôs just a side hobby.

This Chinese-made microphone produces clean audio, and a typical AA battery lasts for weeks, if not months.

There are many Youtube videos online that show how capable this mic is. Check it out if you‚Äôre looking for one!

Books

These are the books I‚Äôve read and enjoyed. I‚Äôll update this section as frequently as I can.

## [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://amzn.to/2TemT30)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [

 ](https://amzn.to/2TemT30)

This is a great book for preparing for software engineering interviews. I particularly enjoyed the high-level data structures/algorithms description, and the depth they cover in the book. In addition, I like that they cover things like how to plan your study schedule using the book, which shows they put a lot of thought into this book.

The questions are quite difficult if you have not done these types of questions. For beginners, I‚Äôd recommend Coding the Cracking Interview, which is another book I recommend here.

## [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://amzn.to/2Teke9I)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5

 ](https://amzn.to/2Teke9I)

This book is perfect for beginners who are starting to prepare for technical interviews. The book covers all the basic data structures such as binary tree, graphs, linked lists, arrays and more. I like that it starts each section with a detailed overview of how a data structure works, and then follows up with questions of the right difficulty.

I also like that they cover some behavioral questions in the book. It‚Äôs a good starting point for everyone. I took this book and added my own spin to it in my own preparation for technical interviews.

## [The Effective Engineer](https://amzn.to/2WjE8Sq)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [

 [

 ](https://amzn.to/2WjE8Sq)

I really enjoyed this book because not only did I pick up many useful tips for my own career growth, but I felt that I could relate to Edmond Lau‚Äôs perspectives in the software industry.

Software engineering is more than just writing code and fixing bugs. I like the way that he puts forth how we can increase our impact through high-leverage activity, which is value per unit time. This has motivated me to start thinking about my day-to-day in terms of how I can increase my impact, and slowly grow towards my dream of becoming a 10x engineer.

## [Crucial Conversations](https://amzn.to/2WjE8Sq)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 5/5  
 [  
 ![](../uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-16-at-8.35.01-PM.png) ](https://amzn.to/39WAZhP)  
 [

 ](https://amzn.to/39WAZhP)

Everyone needs to read this at least once. If you‚Äôre working in a high-stress, high-performance environment, you need to know how to tackle those important conversations. A mentor suggested this book to me, and I picked up a few great tips from it.

I‚Äôve used this to improve not only work relationships, but also personal relationships, with friends, family and loved ones.

## [The Senior Software Engineer](https://amzn.to/2WjGVeK)

_Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥**Ó§¥_ 4/5

A simple practical how-to book that covers many aspects of a software engineer‚Äôs career, such as interviewing, writing, communicating etc.

I think this is a good read for both budding and seasoned software engineers alike. It‚Äôs a quick read, contains actionable items, and very much applicable to a software engineer‚Äôs day-to-day life.

The only downside (not really) that I can think of is that it doesn‚Äôt have more tips. Otherwise, great book with many practical tips.
