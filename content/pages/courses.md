> ### I used to be unsure about what I should do before and during an interview. Zhia‚Äôs courses provide clear tips and suggestions for my guidance on how I should prepare for both technical and non-technical questions. Now I have landed a job from Google and a unicorn company in Silicon Valley. I really appreciated it and would like to recommend Zhia‚Äôs courses to my friends and more people!

Zhia has a great deal of experience where interviewing with top tech companies is concerned. His course not only taught me how to solve tough coding problems, but how to construct a winning resume and communicate effectively. Shortly after the course, I received offers for Software Engineer roles from two start-ups!

 This is a great course to take if you are preparing for software interviews! Zhia covers everything you need to know, including both soft skills and technical skills. He‚Äôll help you understand what the interviewers look for and share good tips based on his own experience as an interviewer and an interviewee. He‚Äôs also a great teacher who‚Äôs friendly, willing to answer questions, and can explain things well. I had a clearer study goal after taking this course.‚Äù‚Äã
