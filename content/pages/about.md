I studied Computer Science at Gonzaga University, and I've been a [Software Engineer (SWE) at Facebook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiachong/) since August 2020. I also enjoyed a stint at Twitter (2017) building ad products. I'm a Top Author on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zhiachong) where I write about software engineering, career growth, and technical interviews. On the side, I run a Youtube channel [@ZhiaChong](https://www.youtube.com/user/TwentyFi5ToLife) where I discuss and share my experience working as a software engineer. I picked up programming and [worked my way into a software engineering career through discipline and hard work](https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-landed-offers-from-microsoft-amazon-and-twitter-without-an-ivy-league-degree-d62cfe286eb8).

### Why I started this blog?

I was born and raised in Malaysia, played a lot of tennis growing up to fill in my time, and played tennis for a Division 1 college. During my college days, I spent a lot of time working in tennis youth camps and helped grow young players. This experience grew my passion for coaching and growing people around me.

I combined two things I love – _programming_ and _coaching_, to come up with the idea for this blog.

This blog aims to help other software engineers or someone who’s looking to break into the software programming industry for the very first time.
